def generate_scatter_plot():
    """
    Generates a scatter plot of restaurant price vs visitor rating,
    encodes the image as a base64 string, and returns the image data.

    The function queries the restaurant database to fetch the name, 
    average price (in USD), and average visitor rating. It uses this 
    data to create a scatter plot with the price on the x-axis and 
    the visitor rating on the y-axis. The restaurant names are shown 
    as labels for each point on the graph.

    Returns:
